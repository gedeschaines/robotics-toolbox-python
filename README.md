Robotics Toolbox for Python

This is an old first attempt at creating an open Python version of the venerable Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB. This is a defunct project that can be mined for parts, it will not be developed further.  

A more active Python port is [robopy](https://github.com/adityadua24/robopy).
