Some tutorial/demos in increasing order of complexity.

transform.py    transforms and quaternions
trajectory.py   trajectories
animation.py    animations
fkine.py        forward kinematics
jacobian.py     Jacbians
ikine.py        inverse dynamics
idyn.py         inverse dynamics, RNE etc.
fdyn.py         forward dynamics

To run a DEMO from a command shell, invoke with python as

  % python DEMO.py
  
or execute from within IPython as
  
  % ipython --pylab
  
  In[1]: run DEMO.py
  
The scripts often pause with a 'more' prompt to stop the text scrolling 
off the screen. Also, when a plot figure is displayed, the figure window
may need to be closed before the script execution continues.

These are command line apps, but could probably be spiffed up with a
wxPython interface.
