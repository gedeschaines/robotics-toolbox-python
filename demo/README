Some Robotics Toolbox (RTB) for Python tutorial/demos in increasing
order of complexity.

my_robot.py     create a simple two-link manipulator
transform.py    transforms and quaternions
trajectory.py   joint trajectories
traj.py         trajectories in more detail
animation.py    animations
fkine.py        forward kinematics
jacobian.py     Jacbians
ikine.py        inverse kinematics
idyn.py         inverse dynamics, RNE etc.
fdyn.py         forward dynamics

To run a DEMO from a command shell, invoke with python as

  > python DEMO.py
  
or execute from within IPython as
  
  > ipython --pylab
  
  In[1]: run DEMO.py

or

  > ipython

  In[1]: %pylab

  In[2]: run DEMO.py
  
The scripts often pause with a 'more' prompt to stop the text scrolling 
off the screen. It helps to clear the terminal screen before running a
demo, and set the terminal screen resolution to 80 characters by 43 lines.
Also, when a plot figure is displayed, the figure window may need to be
closed before the script execution continues.

A note from original developers of RTB for Python:

These are command line apps, but could probably be spiffed up with a
wxPython interface.
