Instructions for using the modified Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB scripts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) It is assumed a RVCTools (RTB) v9 distribution has been installed as
    instructed in its provided README file, and the Octave subdirectory
    scripts installed as directed. See:

    https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-matlab/tree/master/Octave

(2) The scripts in the ./robot/@Link and ./robot/@SerialLink subdirectories
    of this README file must replace like named scripts installed in step (1).
    There is no need to relocate scripts in ./common, ./robot, ./robot/demos,
    ./robot/tests and ./robot/utils subdirectories. The next two steps will
    provide the means for Octave to locate the robot models and utility scripts
    at runtime.

(3) Create an exported environment variable named OCTAVE_RVCT and assign to
    it the complete path to the directory containing this README file. The
    path should end with '/rvctools'.

(4) If the provided .octaverc file is within a working directory from which
    Octave is executed, the complete paths to the ./common, ./robot and 
    robot/utils subdirectories will be prepended to Octave's function search
    path.

(5) Since the mdl_puma560.m, mdl_puma560akb.m and mdl_stanford.m scripts are
    present in the ./robot subdirectory, Octave will issue warnings about
    these functions shadowing core library functions. The warning can be
    ignored, or turned off by placing the following statement

      warning ("off", 'Octave:shadowed-function');

    in the .octaverc file just after the header comment section and before
    the code section containing the addpath statements. The warnings can
    be prevented by copying these scripts to the ./robot subdirectory which
    the Octave @Link, @Quaternion and @SerialLink directories were copied
    to in step (1).

(6) In an Octave Command Window, demo scripts can be executed by using the
    RVCTools runscript function. For example, while the local ./rvctools is
    the current work directory, the graphics demo can be run by entering
    the following:

      >> runscript('./robot/demos/graphics')

    To run a test script, just use the run command. For example, from the
    ./rvctools subdirectory the Jacobian test can be run by entering the
    following:

      >> run ./robot/tests/jacobian

    If in the ./tests subdirectory, the run command is not required. Just
    type the test script name.

      >> jacobian
