Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB Octave Scripts supporting RTB for Python Update Effort
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ideally these updated versions of several Octave and MATLAB scripts should be
introduced in Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB (RTB) source respository
at https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-matlab.  However, as these
modified scripts were directly related to the Robotics Toolbox for Python update
effort, it seemed appropriate to provide them here before formally submitting
them for review as possible candidates for inclusion into the Robotics Toolbox
for MATLAB respository.

Since the base source code used in the RTB for Python update effort is 10 years
old, and the base RTB v9.8 Octave scripts are 7 years old, the changes made to
the scripts identified below may be irrelevant with regard to newer versions of
RTB.  Also, with only Octave v4.0.2 and v4.2.2 currently available to run RTB
for MATLAB, there is a possibility that some modifications to non-Octave specific
scripts may be incompatable with the latest versions of both MATLAB and Octave.
