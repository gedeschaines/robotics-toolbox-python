Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB Octave Scripts supporting RTB for Python Update Effort
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ideally these updated versions of several Octave and MATLAB scripts should be
introduced in Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB (RTB) source respository
at https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-matlab.  However, as these
modified scripts were directly related to the Robotics Toolbox for Python update
effort, it seemed appropriate to provide them here before formally submitting
them for review as possible candidates for inclusion into the Robotics Toolbox
for MATLAB respository.

Since the base source code used in the RTB for Python update effort is 10 years
old, and the base RTB v9.8 Octave scripts are 7 years old, the changes made to
the scripts identified below may be irrelevant with regard to newer versions of
RTB. Also, with only Octave v4.0.2 and v4.2.2, and MATLAB R2018b Home Edition
currently available to run RTB for MATLAB, there is a possibility that some
modifications may be incompatable with older versions of Octave and MATLAB, and
newer versions of Octave.

It should be understood that there are some functions in MATLAB utilized by RTB
for MATLAB that are not yet a core functionality in Octave (e.g., hgtransform)
or are implemented in different manner (e.g., classes); necessitating syntactic
changes to scripts. The isOctave() function has been introduced to wrap Octave
specific code in order to retain a modified script's compatibility with MATLAB.
